    <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a passion for technology. Whether it was tinkering with Apple IIs and Commodore 64s as a child or teaching myself to code at an early age, I’ve been fascinated by technology’s ability to bridge gaps and connect people. Today, I’m still driven by the innovation of technology, and I’ve dedicated my professional career to leading diverse software engineering teams that combine technical excellence with a focus on building highly usable, accessible products that serve their end users.</p>

    <p>I champion hiring processes that attract the widest range of qualified candidates, minimize the impact of unconscious bias, and select for the traits that over 20 years of experience within the industry have shown me are the keys to successful collaboration on everyday technical challenges.</p>

    <p>I’ve managed agile projects through all points in the software life cycle, from initial requirements gathering through to the launch of scalable, award-winning applications across numerous technology stacks. As a senior leader, I’ve found notable success in managing large teams and have led 30+ distributed engineers at once over four continents with multiple engagements including Microsoft, ESPN, Time Magazine, and World Economic Forum.</p>

    <p>When it comes to my teams, I understand engineers are only as efficient as their systems. It’s my belief that teams should be agile about being Agile. If something isn’t working, it’s time to innovate our solutions and strike the right balance between oversight, process, and focused programming time. A successful team also needs a positive workplace environment where they feel valued, included, and respected as a contributor to all our success. As a team leader, I mentor new hires on culture and technical skills that aid in their growth as engineers and collaborators. With these factors combined, we can drive growth and success of both the individual and the team while offering endless possibilities for achievement and creative breakthroughs in technology.</p>

    <p>Alongside my passion for the advancement of technology itself lies a core value that software and content can empower everyone. I firmly believe every person should have the opportunity to learn, find community, and experience joy through technology. I encourage teams to understand and value the needs of all users, regardless of background, age, or disability, and to reflect that understanding in the things they build.</p>

    <p>I have a computer science degree from Roosevelt University and a certificate in Diversity & Inclusion through Cornell University, as well as being a Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies through the International Association of Accessibility Professionals.</p>
