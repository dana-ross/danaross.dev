I'm not a fan of the *move fast and break things* philosophy that permeated our industry in the last decade. People were moving fast, and things were getting broken *a lot*. On the other hand, Chidi's whole character on NBC's *The Good Place* was built around his endless decision paralysis and over-analyzing. And I've seen first-hand the stagnation and compounding problems that stem from inaction.
