At the end of the work day, how do you know what you've accomplished? Who you spoke to? What decisions were made? I've found that keeping a work journal helps me keep perspective while also serving as a vital record of the important conversations I have every day.

## Find a format that works for you
It's up to you what your journal will look like. I like a small, bound diary type book with a hard cover. That way I have something that feels special and will survive bouncing around in my bag all day. But, I've met people who used a paperback notebook, a Day-Timer, or even the Windows notepad app. The form your work journal takes isn't as important as:

* updating it consistently
* writing neatly so you can refer to it later
* recording pertinent details like who you made decisions with
* extracting a list of *to-dos* or *action items* for follow-up

Let's take a look at my journal entry from the other day:

I'm fresh on the job, so you can see my day mostly centered around getting settled in and opening a million Service Desk tickets.

I've highlighted the date because a day's notes can span a couple pages and I may need to find a certain day quickly.

I'm using two colors of pen to draw attention to margin notes, action items, and other special notes. It also makes writing in it more fun.

But this is what works for *me*, and you'll find what works best for you through trial and error. Don't get disappointed and give up if you don't come up with a perfect system right away. Make small changes until you've got a system that keeps you productive and is unmistakably you!

## Update it throughout the day
You carry your phone almost everywhere at work. Your work journal should come along too! Use it to record meetings you attended or important hallway conversations. Did you stop to water the plants? Did you notice a team mate who looked stressed and check in with them? Write those things down too!

The other day, I sat down to eat lunch and I felt terrible, like I hadn't accomplished a single thing all day. I opened my work journal and realized I'd filled up half a page with training videos and new-hire paperwork already! It really gives you a complete picture of everything you squeeze into a work day.

You'll also be able to refer back to it when questions come up. Who had that great idea that saved your bacon today? You chatted about it with Fran while waiting for coffee on the 12th. Was John in the big meeting yesterday? No, John was at his son's violin recital.

## Finish today by planning tomorrow

My wife writes notes to her future self:
> Dear Future Amy,
> 
> Don't forget to send a copy of the slide deck to everybody before the meeting so they come prepared with questions!
>
> -- Past Amy

You should take time to set your future self up for success too!

Block off 15-30 minutes at the end of every work day to reviewe your notes and see what warrants a follow-up. I like to write these *action items* in my work journal so there's a clear relationship between the to-do and what prompted it. Be sure to put these reminders in your paper planner or to-do app as well!

Action items can include things like:
* following up on something you talked about
* discussing a teammate's concern with the right stakeholders
* signing up for additional training on something you noticed you need help with
* taking it easy tomorrow because today was so hectic

This is an important moment for reflection and planning. Approach it with the same seriousness as any other part of your work. Look at it as an investment in tomorrow's success.
