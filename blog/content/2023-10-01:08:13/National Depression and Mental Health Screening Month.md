October is National Depression and Mental Health Screening Month.

Many people are dealing with abuse, addiction, anxietyâ€¦any number of things that affect our mental health. And often, co-workers are the only people they have in their life outside of family. It's important to be there for our teammates when they reach out.

I remember my darkest days, when depression had me living in a fog and you know how I figured it out? My manager had a talk with me about my sudden low performance. Nothing else got through to me. And he was supportive and encouraging when I began treatment, often checking in on how I was feeling and offering support.

Leaders: It's not your place to attempt to diagnose your team members or fix their problems, but you're certainly in your right to point out how they're showing up at work because of it. Familiarize yourself with the benefits your company offers. More than once, I've had to proactively tell my own direct reports that it seems like something is up and I want them to have every resource available. EAPs are free and judgement free. Short term disability can take work off their plates and make time available for treatments or a change in living situations. Health plans cover all sorts of medications and therapies.
