How do you create effective engineering teams? Do they need to be together in the same office? Do they all need to come from the best schools? Do they need to be a collective of team-oriented extroverts? What if we spent money on the best tools out there?

Google researched the question, and the factors most people would think matter don't really have that much impact.

What mattered most is a set of dynamics you can implement on your own teams, no matter what their skill levels or focus areas are, whether they work in an office or remote:

- Psychological Safety: The team's comfort with taking risks without fear of negative repercussions.
- Dependability: Team members' ability to reliably deliver quality work on schedule.
- Structure and Clarity: Clear understanding of job roles, processes, and performance consequences.
- Meaning: The personal significance found in the work or its outcomes.
- Impact: The belief that one's work meaningfully contributes to the organization's goals.
