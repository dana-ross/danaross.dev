I hated the word "accountability" when I first became a leader. I think it was due to both my own naivety and the cold way more seasoned leaders around me spoke of it.

I was told there were three main tools of accountability:

- Feedback
- PIPs
- Termination

All I heard was the last two.

Accountability is not just about firing people. It's about honesty, directness, and compassion. It's sitting down face to face with another adult and letting them know you see a problem well before you need to part ways. It's an invitation for you as a leader to put in extra effort and identify a path to them becoming a success.

Today, accountability is a cornerstone of my approach. I welcome the opportunity to talk to someone I see struggling and I feel so proud when they turn things around.
