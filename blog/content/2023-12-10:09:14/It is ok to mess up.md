It's ok to mess up as you learn.

New hobby: archery. This afternoon was my first time shooting at the far targets. I also wanted to make a few changes to my form, and a surprise crowd beat me to my usual bows.

Changing any one of these things could make for a bad day. Changing all fourâ€¦I made every beginner mistake again!

And that's ok. In fact, I looked forward to it. After all, I was there to improve.

Why are businesses dorks always talking about "growth mindsets"? Because they help us learn. And, we make better decisions when we approach the data with a beginner's curiosity.

Why do we do blameless retrospectives at work? Because embarrassing someone for their mistakes doesn't help either of us learn.
